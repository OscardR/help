# Open a Terminal

To open a Terminal/shell console from within your browser, in the file list view, click the terminal 
button on the top right.

This is a full featured terminal, just like your local one.

If you want to see your running terminals or notebooks, on the files view, click the "Running Processes" button, 
inside the top right options menu ("∙∙∙").
