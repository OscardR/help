# Known issues

* If you're having troubles opening notebooks, please make sure that, from a SWAN terminal, you remove this temporary directory in your CERNBox: `~/.local/share/jupyter`. The latest deployment of SWAN implements an optimisation which makes it redundant.
* When you open the Sharing Panel on a already shared project, you will notice that you no longer see the names of the people you shared with, only the usernames.
* If some element in the UI is not working as expected (i.e if clicking in the share button doesn't open the share dialog), it might be caused by your **adblocker**. Try disabling it for SWAN to see if it's the cause.
