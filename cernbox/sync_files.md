# Synchronize data from your computer

CERNBox provides a [sync client](http://cernbox.web.cern.ch/cernbox/en/synchronisation/) for the majority of platforms (including mobile).
If you install this, you will be able to add files to your account and see them in SWAN.

SWAN interface also has an option for you to upload files. In the files view, if the option is available, a "upload" button 
will appear right next to "+".

You can find a set of examples [here](https://github.com/dpiparo/swanExamples) that you can clone in your CERNBox so that 
they become available to SWAN as well!
