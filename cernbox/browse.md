# Browse files

There are three ways in which you can browse your files:

* You can use the SWAN's Jupyter web interface. Some file types will be browsable besides notebooks, mainly textual formats.
* You can use the [CERNBox web interface](http://cernbox.cern.ch/). You will be able to visualise several file types 
among which notebooks and ROOT files.
* You can use your own machine simply synchronising [CERNBox on your local disk](http://cernbox.web.cern.ch/cernbox/en/synchronisation/).
