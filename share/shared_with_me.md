# Check what others share with you

The **Share** view (accessible by clicking on the **`Share`** tab) also allows you to manage the projects that others have shared with you.

By hovering over those projects, you will see a **`Clone`** button appearing. If you click it, you will be asked for the name you want to give to the project and, by hitting **`Clone`** again to confirm, the contents of the project will be copied into your CERNBox. Soon after that the project will be opened for you and you will be able to browse its contents.

Please note that the contents of your new project are a copy of the original ones. This is due to the fact that Jupyter does not currently support concurrent editing of the same notebook file by multiple users.

The SWAN team is currently implementing a mechanism for users to inspect the content of a shared project before cloning it, so they have more information to decide if they want to perform the copy or not.
