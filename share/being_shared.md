# Check what you share

When opening the Share view (clicking on the "Share" tab), you will see a list with the projects you have shared and 
those that others shared with you.

There you will be able to edit the people you share your projects with, or even stop sharing. Just over the project name
and the "Edit sharing" button will appear. Click it, and the Sharing Panel will appear.
