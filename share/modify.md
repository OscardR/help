# Modify/stop a sharing

The same options that you had to start sharing a Project are available if you want to add or remove people from the sharing,
or even remove the sharing all together.

If you are in the Projects view, when you hover a shared Project, instead of the "Share" button will see the "Edit sharing" one.
By clicking it, you will open the Sharing Panel, with a button to update the share and another to stop sharing.

![][edit_share]

The same will happen if you click the share button that appears inside a Project, or in the notebook editor view.
