# Known issues

* f you encounter this error make sure that, from a SWAN terminal, you remove this temporary directory in your CERNBox: 
~/.local/share/jupyter. The latest deployment of SWAN implements an optimisation which makes it redundant.
* When you open the Sharing Panel on a already shared project, you will notice that you no longer see the names of the 
people you shared with, only the usernames.
